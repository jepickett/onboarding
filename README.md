# Onboarding Types used by Translators
## [Onboarding is a generic term for any setup, pairing, auth, etc. that one typically needs to do before communicating with a device](node/README.md)
The alpha version defines a few Onboarding Types that are used by Open Translators to Things. We would love to see the community add more Onboarding Types for different categories of things.
